# Kubernetes Infrastructure Work - September 13, 2025

## What We Accomplished

Today we successfully integrated the admin UI into the existing Kubernetes infrastructure and resolved several critical deployment issues. The main achievements were:

**Admin UI Integration**: We added the admin frontend to the Kubernetes deployment pipeline, updating all four deployment scripts (`build-images.sh`, `deploy.sh`, `teardown.sh`, `restart-k8s-rollout.sh`) to include the admin UI build and deployment process. We resolved port conflicts by changing the admin service from port 30001 to 30002, and fixed Docker build issues in the admin frontend by adding missing `tsconfig.json` and fixing TypeScript compilation errors.

**Ingress Routing Fix**: The most complex issue we solved was the admin UI showing a blank page when accessed via ingress. After extensive debugging of the Nginx Ingress Controller's Lua backend discovery mechanism, we discovered a hostname conflict where both the ingress controller's internal endpoints and our ingress rules were using `localhost`. This prevented the ingress controller from properly managing its own backends. We resolved this by changing the ingress host from `localhost` to `admin.econ-graph.local` and configuring CoreDNS with a static hosts entry, creating proper separation between internal cluster communication and external access.

**Chart API Service Fix**: We resolved Docker build failures in the `chart-api-service` where the build was failing due to existing user/group IDs. We modified the Dockerfile to gracefully handle existing user/group creation, and fixed image tagging mismatches in the deployment process.

## How You Could Be Better at Helping Me

Your guidance on using the reproducible deployment scripts was crucial and helped me avoid manual kubectl operations that could lead to inconsistencies. A few areas where your input was particularly valuable:

1. **Insisting on Script Usage**: You repeatedly reminded me to use `scripts/deploy/restart-k8s-rollout.sh` instead of manual docker builds and kubectl commands. This enforced reproducibility and caught several issues I might have missed.

2. **Focusing on Infrastructure First**: When we encountered the MCP server issues, you correctly directed me to focus on infrastructure problems (Chart API, backend startup) before diving into application-level debugging.

3. **Strategic Problem Solving**: You encouraged deep investigation rather than quick fixes, especially with the ingress routing issue where you pushed me to understand the root cause of the Nginx Lua backend discovery problem rather than applying workarounds.

Going forward, your approach of "investigate first, then decide on fixes" and insistence on using proper deployment workflows continues to be the right strategy.

**Areas for Improvement**: There were a few times where clearer initial direction would have saved time. For example, when I was manually debugging the ingress issue with kubectl commands, it would have been helpful if you had immediately directed me to use the deployment scripts rather than letting me go down that path first. Also, when we were deep in the MCP investigation, you could have been more explicit earlier about when to abandon an approach - I spent significant time on the Warp filter debugging when a more direct "this isn't working, let's step back" signal would have been valuable.

## What I Learned

**Nginx Ingress Controller Deep Dive**: I gained significant understanding of how the Nginx Ingress Controller works internally, particularly the Lua-based backend discovery mechanism and how hostname conflicts can break the controller's ability to manage service endpoints. The investigation revealed that `localhost` hostname conflicts can cause the ingress controller's internal endpoints (`/configuration/backends`, `/metrics`, `/healthz`) to be hijacked by user ingress rules.

**Kubernetes Service Discovery**: I learned the importance of proper separation between internal cluster communication (using CoreDNS and cluster IPs) and external access (using ingress with custom hostnames). The solution using `admin.econ-graph.local` with CoreDNS hosts plugin and `/etc/hosts` configuration provides a clean separation of concerns.

**Docker Build Optimization**: Working with the Chart API service Dockerfile issues taught me about handling existing user/group IDs in Alpine Linux containers and the importance of graceful error handling in Docker build scripts.

**Deployment Script Integration**: I learned the value of systematic integration - updating all deployment scripts consistently rather than just the ones that seemed immediately relevant. This prevented configuration drift and ensured all deployment paths worked correctly.

The MCP server investigation, while ultimately abandoned, revealed some interesting patterns about Warp filter chains and error handling that could be valuable for future debugging sessions.
