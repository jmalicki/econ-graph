## Workflow Validation and Maintenance

### Automated CI/CD Workflow Validation
- **Validation Automation**: Create automated scripts in `ci/scripts/` to validate all GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- **YAML Syntax Checking**: Ensure all workflow files have valid YAML syntax
- **Job Structure Validation**: Verify all jobs have proper `steps` sections and valid configurations
- **Orphaned Workflow Detection**: Identify workflows with no active triggers that may be causing CI noise
- **Naming Consistency**: Ensure all workflows have descriptive names for better maintainability

### Validation Principles
1. **Syntax Validation**: Validate YAML syntax before deployment
2. **Structure Validation**: Ensure every job has a non-empty `steps` section
3. **Trigger Validation**: Check for active triggers (push, pull_request, schedule, workflow_dispatch, repository_dispatch)
4. **Naming Validation**: Verify workflows have descriptive names
5. **Error Reporting**: Provide clear, actionable error messages

### Integration with CI/CD
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run workflow validation before committing changes
- **CI Pipeline Integration**: Include validation in the main CI pipeline to catch issues early
- **Automated Testing**: Treat workflow validation as a first-class test that must pass
- **Documentation**: Maintain validation processes as part of the standard RelEng toolkit

### Common Issues to Detect
- **Invalid Job Definitions**: Jobs without `steps` sections (causes 0s duration failures)
- **Orphaned Workflows**: Workflows from deleted branches showing as active in GitHub
- **Malformed YAML**: Syntax errors that prevent workflow parsing
- **Missing Triggers**: Workflows that can't be executed
- **Poor Naming**: Workflows without descriptive names making maintenance difficult

## Docker-Based CI/CD Patterns

### Build Strategy
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage Dockerfiles to separate build and runtime environments
- **Layer Caching**: Optimize Docker layer caching by ordering commands from least to most frequently changing
- **Build Context**: Minimize build context size by using `.dockerignore` and copying only necessary files
- **Base Image Selection**: Choose appropriate base images (e.g., `rust:1.88-slim` for Rust projects)
- **Dependency Caching**: Copy dependency files (Cargo.toml, package.json) before source code for better caching

### Test Execution
- **Containerized Tests**: Run all tests inside Docker containers for consistency
- **Database Services**: Use Docker Compose to spin up test databases and services
- **Test Isolation**: Each test run gets a fresh container environment
- **Parallel Execution**: Run different test suites in parallel using separate containers
- **Resource Management**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits for test containers

### CI/CD Integration
- **Script Delegation**: Keep GitHub Actions workflows simple by delegating to scripts
- **One-Liner Jobs**: Each CI job step should be a single command that calls a script
- **Environment Variables**: Pass configuration through environment variables to containers
- **Artifact Sharing**: Use Docker image tags to share built artifacts between jobs
- **Cache Strategy**: Leverage both Docker layer caching and GitHub Actions cache

### Script Organization
- **Centralized Scripts**: Place all CI logic in `ci/scripts/` directory
- **Modular Design**: Create separate scripts for different concerns (build, test, deploy)
- **Parameterization**: Make scripts configurable through command-line arguments
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and exit codes in scripts
- **Documentation**: Document script usage and parameters clearly

### Example Patterns
```bash
# Backend build script
./ci/scripts/backend-build.sh

# Backend test script with options
./ci/scripts/backend-test.sh --unit
./ci/scripts/backend-test.sh --integration
./ci/scripts/backend-test.sh --all

# Frontend build script
./ci/scripts/frontend-build.sh

# E2E test script
./ci/scripts/run-tests.sh --group core
```

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: Same environment across local development, CI, and production
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic builds and test results
- **Caching**: Better caching through Docker layers and GitHub Actions
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and debug CI processes
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new test types or build configurations
