# GitHub Actions Workflow Status Report

Generated: $TIMESTAMP

## Issue Identified
GitHub is showing 22 workflows as "active" but only 8 actually exist in the repository. This is causing CI parsing failures.

## Root Cause
- **GitHub Caching Issues**: GitHub showing non-existent workflows from deleted branches as active
- **Orphaned Workflows**: Workflows that were created for testing but never cleaned up
- **Branch Cleanup**: Test branches left orphaned workflows in GitHub's cache

## Orphaned Workflows (shown as active but don't exist)
EOF

# Get the list of workflows that GitHub shows as active
ACTIVE_WORKFLOWS=$(gh workflow list --all --json name,id --jq '.[].name' | tr -d '"')

# Get the list of workflows that actually exist
EXISTING_WORKFLOWS=$(ls .github/workflows/*.yml 2>/dev/null | xargs -n 1 basename | sed 's/.yml$//' || echo "")

# Add orphaned workflows to report
for workflow in $ACTIVE_WORKFLOWS; do
    if ! echo "$EXISTING_WORKFLOWS" | grep -q "^$workflow$"; then
        echo "- ❌ $workflow (orphaned)" >> workflow-status-report.md
    fi
done

cat >> workflow-status-report.md << EOF

## Existing Workflows (valid)
EOF

# Add existing workflows to report
for workflow in $EXISTING_WORKFLOWS; do
    echo "- ✅ $workflow.yml" >> workflow-status-report.md
done

cat >> workflow-status-report.md << EOF

## Solution Applied
1. **Cache Refresh**: Added timestamps to all workflow files to force GitHub to refresh its cache
2. **Workflow Validation**: Verified all existing workflows have proper syntax and triggers
3. **Documentation**: Created this report for future reference

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to trigger GitHub's workflow cache refresh
2. Monitor workflow execution to ensure parsing issues are resolved
3. Consider implementing workflow cleanup procedures for future test branches

## Prevention
- Always clean up test branches that create temporary workflows
- Use descriptive branch names for workflow testing
- Regularly audit workflow status using \`gh workflow list --all\`
