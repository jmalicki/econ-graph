/// **DataPoint Model**
///
/// Represents a single observation in an economic time series, containing both the actual
/// data value and important metadata about data provenance and revisions.
///
/// Economic data is frequently revised by statistical agencies (like the BLS, BEA, Federal Reserve)
/// as more complete information becomes available. This model captures both the original releases
/// and subsequent revisions, enabling users to track how economic indicators change over time
/// and understand the reliability of real-time vs. final data.
///
/// # Use Cases
/// - Storing individual observations from economic time series (GDP, unemployment, inflation, etc.)
/// - Tracking data revisions and their impact on economic analysis
/// - Supporting real-time economic monitoring and nowcasting
/// - Enabling historical analysis of data revision patterns
///
/// # Database Schema
/// Maps to the `data_points` table in PostgreSQL with full ACID compliance.
/// Indexes are maintained on `series_id`, `date`, and `revision_date` for optimal query performance.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use econ_graph_backend::models::DataPoint;
/// use uuid::Uuid;
/// use chrono::{NaiveDate, Utc};
/// use bigdecimal::BigDecimal;

/// - Raw levels show absolute values but can obscure trends due to scale

/// - Economic research requiring different data perspectives
/// - Chart visualization with user-selectable transformations

/// - Trend analysis and cycle identification
